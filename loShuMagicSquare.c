Lo Shu Magic Square

int[][] array

Main is defined in main, no input from user needed

contains numbers 1 - 9 exactly
NO NUMBER REPEATED
each row, column, and diagonal must add up to the same number
2d array
function that accepts a 2d array as arg and determine if the array is a lo shu magic square
put random number placement into loop until array is a lo shu magic square

Print results:
    total number of squares generated and tested before success (recording by counting the loop)
    Print the final square and its placements
    [a b c]
    [d e f]
    [g h i]
